Well, a little bit about me, I am totally and madly passionate about programming😍🥰

I am always aiming to create applications that are intuitive for users, robust and scalable🎯💪


I ❤️ to work with several technologies, but my very favourites are:
### 👁️ Front-end
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Zustand, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material UI, Styled Components;
### ⬅️ Back-end
- Node.js, Express.js;
### 🗃️ Data Base
- Sequelize, PostgreSQL.
### 🛠️ Utilities
- GitHub, Figma, Trello, Canvas, Calendly, GitLab (among others).
  
### Learning:
-  **Typescript** 👌 (I think it's going to be even most popular than now in the near future),
-  **Next.JS** ..... is the bomb!!!💣💥
